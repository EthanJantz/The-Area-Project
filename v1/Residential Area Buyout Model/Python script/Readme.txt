Readme 

The two accompanying files titled " data_base_version_1.py" and v1.1_data_cleaner.py" are meant to assist in data analysis of outputs generated by netlogo.

Please make a copy both files and place them into the same directory as the net-logo outputs.  

In order to use these file you need to  have an IDE  and at least  Python 3+. You can run the files directly from python launcher.  The IDE helps if  when edits are needed. 

Cleaner File:

This file must be ran first as it organizes the various files from net logo for the creation of the database. The file will always output a csv named output.csv

DataBase File:
This file can be run after the cleaner file has been run. The database names the database for you. If you would like to change the name open the file with a text editor or IDE and change the  sting value associated with "file_title" in initial line of code.


Errors
--- changing output values or order in net-logo will impact the functioning of python scripts so correlate changes
--- duplicate database files in the folder will cause data-base builder not to run. Every time it runs it will create a database even if there is nothing in it--always check and delete if not in sue
--- cleaner tool will seeking to aggregate all netlogo output in folder no matter the number of them. Be sure the data in the folder is the data you want aggregated. 
--- cleaner tool and meta_datafile, the cleaner tool will look for "meta_data.csv" output to begin aggregating. Netlogog produces many  iterations in a run. You need them all. They are differentiated by "meta_data"data-time"" However you do not need two files with the exact name "meta_data.csv". Be sure to delete previous run outputs or this could happen and you data can be compiled incorrectly.
